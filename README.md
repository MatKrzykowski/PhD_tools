# PhD tools

Collection of minor tools developed for my PhD thesis:
* Asymmetry_measure - Julia script used to calculating asymmetry measure given kp Hamiltonian 
* Gnuplot_latex - bash function used for generation of graph PDFs using gnuplot and LaTeX
* Hamiltonian_symmetry - Julia script used for simulating symmetry of a Hamiltonian with a piezoelectric field
